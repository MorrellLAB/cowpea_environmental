## UCR collaborators cowpea GWAS

## SNP positions - GitHub repository for annotations
[SNP_Utils](https://github.com/MorrellLAB/cowpea_annotation/tree/main/Results)

## Passport data
* Full passport data includes market collections & breeding material
* Some samples have localities, but no latitude and longitude
[Full passport data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/33pkna1l2ckjrgp/IITA_Core_2021_PassportData.xlsx?dl=0)
* A cleaned passport data file does not include market collection or breeding material
* Maybe possible to supplement with inferred latitude & longitude
* Spreadsheet contains two sheets - 1st sheet has landraces with some locality data
* The second sheet has full latitude & longitude that was sent to [Kevin Volz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvolz) for GIS

## Genotyping calls
* This genotyping dataset uses UCR Minicore Cluster file (generated by Maria Mu√±oz)

## Bioclim source data
* EarthStat is focused on agricultural data, WorldClim is environmental data worldwide
* Focus on precipitation & temperature

[WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org)

## Maps of collection localities
* Collection locality & temperature
